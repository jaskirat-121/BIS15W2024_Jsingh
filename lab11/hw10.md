## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight

## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?


```r
deserts %>% count(genus, sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 × 2
##    genus                n
##    <chr>            <int>
##  1 Dipodomys        16167
##  2 Chaetodipus       6029
##  3 Onychomys         3267
##  4 Reithrodontomys   2694
##  5 Peromyscus        2234
##  6 Perognathus       1629
##  7 Neotoma           1252
##  8 Ammospermophilus   437
##  9 Amphispiza         303
## 10 Spermophilus       249
## # ℹ 16 more rows
```

```r
deserts %>% count(species,sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species          n
##    <chr>        <int>
##  1 merriami     10596
##  2 penicillatus  3123
##  3 ordii         3027
##  4 baileyi       2891
##  5 megalotis     2609
##  6 spectabilis   2504
##  7 torridus      2249
##  8 flavus        1597
##  9 eremicus      1299
## 10 albigula      1252
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```

There is a total of 34,786 observations. Merriami is the most represented species. Several species are only represented once in the data set and include: clarki, scutalatus, tereticaudus, tigris, uniparens, and viridis. 


3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.


```r
options(scipen=999)
```



```r
deserts %>% 
  tabyl(taxa)
```

```
##     taxa     n      percent
##     Bird   450 0.0129362387
##   Rabbit    75 0.0021560398
##  Reptile    14 0.0004024608
##   Rodent 34247 0.9845052607
```

```r
deserts %>% 
  tabyl(taxa) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa, y=n))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  labs(title="Number of Obseravtions in Each Taxa",
       x= "Taxa",
       y= "Log10(n)")
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->



4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`


```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa, fill=plot_type))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Number of Obseravtions in Each Taxa",
       x= "Taxa",
       y= "Log10(n)")+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->


5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.


```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(weight != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->


6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.


```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(weight != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_point()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->


7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?


```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(species == "merriami") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->


8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.


```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_jitter(size=0.5)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->
Over plotting is an issue in this case. There appears to be three groupings of data and an increase in weight does not increase hindfoot_length as there is a plateau in the data. 



9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.


```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight=mean(weight, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_weight)) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      mean_weight
##    <chr>              <dbl>
##  1 albigula           159. 
##  2 spectabilis        120. 
##  3 spilosoma           93.5
##  4 hispidus            65.6
##  5 fulviventer         58.9
##  6 ochrognathus        55.4
##  7 ordii               48.9
##  8 merriami            43.2
##  9 baileyi             31.7
## 10 leucogaster         31.6
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(species == "albigula"| species == "spectabilis") %>% 
  select(species, weight, hindfoot_length,sex) %>% 
  filter (sex != "NA") %>% 
  filter(weight != "NA") %>% 
  filter(hindfoot_length != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(ratio= weight/hindfoot_length) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=ratio, fill=sex))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->


10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.


```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(hindfoot_length != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=genus, hindfoot_length, fill= species))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  scale_y_log10()+
  labs(title= "Hindfoot Length of Recorded Genus",
       x= "Genus")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))
```
